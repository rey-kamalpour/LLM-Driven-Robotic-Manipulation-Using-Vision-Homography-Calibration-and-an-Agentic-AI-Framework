# LLM-Driven Robotic Manipulation

An agentic AI–driven robotic manipulation system for natural-language pick-and-place tasks.  
Using ArUco-based homography calibration and an LLM for task planning, the robot reliably detects objects and executes accurate grasping and placement through predefined motion primitives.
